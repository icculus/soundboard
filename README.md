# soundboard

This is some code I wrote for a custom sound board. It's a Raspberry Pi with
an HDMI screen, a bunch of buttons on a USB joystick encoder, and an amp, all
hooked up to a USB battery.

This program runs at startup, and uses SDL3 to draw a waveform to the screen,
and play sounds when a button is hit.

It's not fancy, but it got the job done.
